# SoccerDB includes parts of the code, configuration files, and model
## detection
### All of the detection experiments are powered by [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). The process is as follows:
### 1: Build the environment for [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
### 2: Process the detection data in coco format.
### 3: Config files and models are in [detection](https://github.com/newsdata/SoccerDB/tree/master/code/detection).
